# Architecture

## v1.0 Shape

Better Task Manager v1.0 is a single Windows desktop executable.

```text
WinForms UI
  -> process collector
  -> network connection snapshot collector
  -> Windows Firewall commands
  -> Windows memory maintenance APIs
```

## Current Collection Model

The app collects live process data directly from Windows process APIs and maps connection rows back to process IDs where possible.

Connection snapshots are written locally and pruned to a maximum retention window of 30 days.

## Planned Collection Model

Portmaster-style per-app bandwidth and rule decisions need a different architecture:

```text
Desktop UI
  -> local API
  -> background Windows service
  -> ETW/WFP collector
  -> local event database
  -> firewall/rule engine
```

That split keeps the UI responsive and allows network observation to continue even when the desktop window is closed.
